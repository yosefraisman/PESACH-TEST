## Synopsis
This C++ project prints out the traditional Passover song "Echad Mi Yodea"
## Insight and Recommended Reading
While this repo was primarily made to test out SSH'ing into GitHub from the command line in Linux, there are quite a few interesting things we can say about cumulative songs in general and "Echad Mi Yodea" specifically.

I recommend following these links for more information:
* [The Complexity of Songs](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/Software.coe/242-535_ADA/Background/Readings/knuth_song_complexity.pdf), by Donald Knuth; An amusing article which applies computational complexity calculation to popular songs.
* [Thirteen Attributes of Mercy](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%A9_%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA), in Wikipedia; This link will hopefully sort out the confusion around the meaning of the song's 13th verse.
